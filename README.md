# Piano Performance Analysis with Music Transformers

**State-of-the-art transformer-based approach for predicting perceptual dimensions of piano performance**

## Research Goal

Develop cutting-edge Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) models to predict 19 perceptual dimensions of piano performance, building on the PercePiano dataset with modern deep learning architectures for potential graduate-level research contributions.

**Perceptual Dimensions**: Timing, Articulation, Pedal, Timbre, Dynamics, Musical Expression, Emotion, Interpretation

## Approach

**Current Phase**: Music Transformer Implementation

- ✅ PercePiano dataset analysis (1202 performances, 19 dimensions)
- ✅ Audio preprocessing pipeline (librosa-based)
- ✅ Baseline neural networks (correlation analysis completed)
- 🚧 Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) implementation
- 🎯 Multi-task transformer training on mel-spectrograms

**Technical Foundation**: JAX/Flax implementation following SOTA transformer architectures

## Technical Architecture

### Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST)
- **Input**: Mel-spectrograms (128 frequency bins × time frames)
- **Patch Embedding**: 16×16 patches → 768-dimensional vectors
- **Transformer**: 12-layer encoder with multi-head self-attention
- **Multi-task Head**: 19 parallel regression outputs for perceptual dimensions

### Training Pipeline
- **Framework**: JAX/Flax for high-performance training
- **Optimization**: AdamW with cosine learning rate scheduling
- **Evaluation**: Pearson correlation per dimension + cross-validation

## Dataset Insights

**PercePiano Analysis:**
- **1202 performances** across 19 perceptual dimensions
- **22 professional performers**, classical repertoire (Schubert, Beethoven)
- **Perceptual ratings**: [0-1] normalized, mean=0.553
- **Key correlations**: Musical expression dimensions show strong inter-relationships

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1**: AST Baseline (Current)
1. Implement Audio Spectrogram Transformer architecture
2. Train on PercePiano mel-spectrograms → 19-dimensional ratings  
3. Achieve SOTA performance (target: >0.7 correlation on key dimensions)
4. Comprehensive evaluation and comparison with baseline approaches

**Phase 2**: Research Extensions (Future)
- Cross-cultural musical perception studies
- Interpretable attention visualization
- Few-shot learning for new instruments
- Real-time performance feedback applications
