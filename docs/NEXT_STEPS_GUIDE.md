## 🔥 **Option A: CNN Approach** (Industry Standard)

### **What CNNs Bring:**

```python
# Current: Hand-crafted features
audio → [tempo, spectral_centroid, rms_mean, ...] → NN → ratings

# CNN: Learn features automatically  
audio → mel_spectrogram → CNN → learned_features → ratings
      (128, 619)     (2D conv)   (rich representation)
```

### **CNN Architecture Example:**

```python
class PianoCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        # Input: mel-spectrogram (1, 128, 619)
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3)    # → (32, 126, 617)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3)   # → (64, 124, 615)  
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)                   # Reduce size
        self.fc = nn.Linear(64 * reduced_size, 19)       # → 19 outputs
```

### **Why CNNs Excel for Audio:**

- **Automatic feature learning**: Discovers patterns you can't hand-craft
- **Translation invariance**: Same musical pattern at different times  
- **Hierarchical features**: Low-level (notes) → High-level (musical phrases)
- **Industry proven**: Used by Spotify, Google, research papers

### **Expected Performance Boost:**

- Single-task: 0.35 → **0.60-0.80** correlation
- Multi-task: 0.086 → **0.25-0.40** average correlation

## 🔧 **Option B: Enhanced Traditional ML**

### **Real Audio Processing:**

Instead of synthetic features, process actual audio files:

```python
# Process all 1202 performances  
for performance in all_performances:
    if audio_file_exists(performance):
        features = extract_real_features(performance)
        # Train on real audio-rating pairs
```

### **Advanced Feature Engineering:**

```python
features = {
    'temporal': [tempo, rhythm_complexity, beat_strength],
    'spectral': [mfccs, spectral_contrast, tonnetz], 
    'harmonic': [chroma, key_strength, chord_changes],
    'percussive': [onset_strength, attack_time, decay_rate]
}
# ~50-100 engineered features vs current 10
```

### **Expected Improvement:**

- Better features → 0.35 → **0.50-0.60** correlation
- More data → 300 → **1202** samples

## 🎼 **Option C: Transformer Architecture** (State-of-the-Art)

### **Music-Specific Transformers:**

```python
# Treat audio as sequence of frames
mel_spectrogram → sequence_of_frames → Transformer → attention_weights → ratings
(128, 619)        [(128,), (128,), ...] → self_attention → focused_features
```

### **Why Transformers Work for Music:**

- **Long-range dependencies**: Connect musical phrases across time
- **Attention mechanisms**: Focus on important musical moments  
- **Sequence modeling**: Music is inherently sequential
- **Transfer learning**: Pre-trained models (Jukebox, MusicBERT)

### **Complexity vs Benefit:**

- **Pros**: State-of-the-art performance, interpretable attention
- **Cons**: Complex architecture, requires more data/compute

---

## 🏗️ **Option D: Hybrid Approach** (Recommended for Learning)

### **Combine Multiple Approaches:**

```python
class HybridPianoNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        # CNN branch for spectrograms
        self.cnn_branch = PianoCNN()
        
        # Traditional branch for engineered features  
        self.feature_branch = FeedForwardNet()
        
        # Fusion layer
        self.fusion = nn.Linear(cnn_features + scalar_features, 19)
```

### **Learning Benefits:**

- **Compare approaches**: See CNN vs traditional performance
- **Understand trade-offs**: Complexity vs interpretability
- **Gradual complexity**: Add components step by step

- CNN depth: 3-5 convolutional layers
- Kernel sizes: (3,3) or (5,5) for musical patterns
- Pooling strategy: MaxPool vs AvgPool
- Output: Single-task vs Multi-task
```

## 💡 **My Recommendation**

**Start with CNN (Option A)** because:

- ✅ **Maximum learning value**: New concepts + practical skills
- ✅ **Performance boost**: Will see dramatic improvement  
- ✅ **Industry alignment**: How real systems work
- ✅ **Foundation building**: Enables advanced techniques later

**Then consider** hybrid approaches once CNN is working.
